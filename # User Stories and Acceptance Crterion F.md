As a child I want to be able to interact with the game without knowing how to count past ~500 so that I can play the game without being thrown questions above my math level. It should also be entertaining to children perhaps with flashing lights and sound.

As someone who enjoys puzzles I want to be challenged with absurdly large numbers so I can have an app that challenges my puzzle solving skills. It should also have good hints so solving he puzzle is fair.

As someone who wants something to pass the time I want a middle ground between questions for children and the challenging questions for math people so I can have fun at my level. This means that There should be different difficulties for the different people playing the game.

As someone who wants to be in the leaderboards I want the game to go for a long time so I can make an impressive score. This means the game should be able to count high enough that the scores are impressive and arent easily cheated.

As someone who wants to mess around with friends I want the game to have properly integrated multiplayer elements that make the game for fun with friends. This means that the game should be able to stably run with mulitple people.
