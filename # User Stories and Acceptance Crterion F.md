# User Stories and Acceptance Crterion Frame

As a child I want to be able to interact with the game without knowing how to count past ~500 so that I can play the game without being thrown questions above my math level.

As someone who enjoys puzzles I want to be challenged with absurdly large numbers so I can have an app that challenges my puzzle solving skills.

As someone who wants something to pass the time I want a middle ground between questions for children and the challenging questions for math people so I can have fun at my level.

As someone who wants to be in the leaderboards I want the game to go for a long time so I can make an impressive score

As someone who wants to mess around with friends I want the game to have properly integrated multiplayer elements that make the game for fun with friends.
