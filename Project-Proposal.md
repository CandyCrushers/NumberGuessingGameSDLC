### 1. App Idea

The number guessing game, "Numble," is inspired by the popular New York Times game, Wordle. Players will guess numbers in a Wordle-like manner. For each incorrect guess, players will receive a clue to guide them. The game offers both timed and non-timed modes, where users can see how long it takes to solve the puzzle, similar to Wordle. Additionally, players can challenge each other in a 1v1 format.
